Ruby on Rails is the reason I chose software development as a career.

The first time I saw it in 2014, I remember asking myself:

> Where are the brackets, semi-colons, symbols...?
> 
> Why didn't public static inherit void main?
> 
> How does `has_many :orders` and `belongs_to :company` work?

I've been in love with it ever since.

I've come a long way from there. I've started a company with Rails. I've built many side projects with Rails. I've worked a few jobs with Rails. I've helped many non-technical people learn Ruby and Rails.


After 10 years of love, I've started digging deeper into Rails. I'm now comfortable opening gems and tweaking them as per my needs.

I submitted my first issue to Rails recently: [rails/rails#55627](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/55627).
I'm running a client project on a [fork that solves that issue](https://github.com/rails/rails/compare/main...fazzledev:rails:main).

I will contribute more to Rails and other open-source projects soon.
