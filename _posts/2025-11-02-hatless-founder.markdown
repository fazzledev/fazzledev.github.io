Principals at big companies make a common mistake when starting up. They bring their enterprise-scale solutions to small-scale problems.
 
A Principal Data Scientist at a VC-funded company started a DAaaS business - Data Analytics as a Service. Their clients would give them their business data and expect actionable insights in return.

When he got his first client, he was off to races on the tools he knew best - Python on Jupyter Notebooks. After spending many days he had nothing to show except complex mathematical models and highly technical graphs - none of which made any sense to his client.

That's when he reached out to me and I'm not a data scientist. I loaded the data onto a spreadsheet and did some simple analysis. In a couple of hours I gave him some actionable insights which his client found interesting.
