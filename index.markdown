Hey! I'm Fazil. I write Rails code for a living, and honestly? I wouldn't have it any other way.

While everyone else is jumping between frameworks and learning the latest shiny thing, I've been sticking with Rails. It's not that I'm against trying new stuff—it's just that Rails has become my thing. I like the way it works, the community around it, and how it helps me build stuff that actually works.

When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me tinkering with open source stuff or diving into some gem that caught my eye. I also enjoy helping other developers get into Rails—there's something satisfying about watching someone "get it" for the first time.
