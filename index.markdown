Hey! I'm Fazil. I build Rails apps for a living, and honestly? I wouldn't have it any other way.

It's not that I'm against trying new stuff—it's just that Rails has become my thing. I like the way it works, the community around it, and how its principles perfectly fit my mind.

I also enjoy helping other developers get into Rails — there's something satisfying about watching someone "get it" for the first time. When I'm not coding, I'm a casual footballer (soccer) who plays 2-3 times a week, usually as a goalkeeper or striker.
