I'm a Rails-only developer, and I like it that way.

While the tech world spins with new frameworks, languages, and shiny objects every week, I've found my home in Ruby on Rails. There's something beautiful about mastering one framework deeply rather than chasing every trend. Rails gives me everything I need to build robust, maintainable web applications—from convention over configuration to the vibrant ecosystem that's grown around it.

When I'm not writing Rails code, you might find me contributing to open source projects, exploring the gems ecosystem, or helping other developers discover the joy of working with Rails. I believe in building things that work, that last, and that make sense—and Rails has consistently delivered on all fronts for me.
