Hey there! Are you looking for a highly skilled CTO-level freelancer?

I'm a Ruby on Rails developer at the core with layers of other useful skills on top and an unwavering focus on your success. I carry at least three kinds of skills in my tool-belt - technical, operational, and experiential.

With these broad and complementary skill sets, I deliver apps that are functional, fast, secure, scalable, and maintainable. But that's just the basic stuff. I deliver my apps in frequent, flexible, and flowing phases. I craft the user's interactions to fit like a glove and fall in love.

I'm passionate about my work product and take full ownership of its success. Every client is a long-term relationship, and an opportunity to solve problems for the good for our fellow humans.
